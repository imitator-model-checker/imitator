release XXX    (XXXX) FUTURE RELEASE

Major feature:
- New algorithms EFmin and EFmax synthesizing the min (resp. max) valuation of a single given parameter for which a given state is reachable
- The GrML syntax (in and out) is now discontinued, as CosyVerif is not maintained anymore, and the next version will not support GrML.

Minor feature:
- New option to convert exact-valued discrete variables into (possibly approximated) floats in all outputs
- New option -romeo (April 1st 2017 feature)… Try it ;-)

Bug fixing
- Fixed a bug in the parsing module that crashed IMITATOR when a discrete was assigned to an undeclared variable

Internal
- Better separation between the discrete variables and other variables in guards, so as to first check whether the discrete part is satisfiable (which is cheap) before checking the continuous part (which is expensive)


*******************************************************
release 2.9.1    (2017-04-01) MINOR RELEASE

Major feature:
- The GrML syntax (in and out) is now discontinued, as CosyVerif is not maintained anymore, and the next version will not support GrML.

Minor feature:
- New option -romeo (April 1st 2017 feature)… Try it ;-)


*******************************************************
release 2.9    (2017-03-23) MAJOR RELEASE

Major
- New algorithm LoopSynthesis (option -mode LoopSynth): synthesizes valuations for which there exists an infinite run in the model.
- New algorithms for non-Zeno cycle emptiness checking: with CUB-detection (-mode NZCUBcheck) or transformation to a CUB-PTA (-mode NZCUBtrans) [still in an experimental phase]
- EFsynth rewritten to output a single, disjunctive constraint (instead of a list of constraints as until version 2.8); Legacy version still usable using option -mode EFold
- PRP and PRPC now disconnected from IM and BC: new syntax (-mode PRP and -mode PRPC), and result in the form of a single good and/or bad constraint.

Minor features
- Variables not used in a model apart from resets (or updates) are simply removed entirely, so as to speed up the execution. If that behavior is not the one intended by the user, this automatic removal can be disabled using the new option -no-var-autoremove.
- (Limited) colored terminal output :-)

Bug fixing
- Solved a bug for EF / PRP when the initial state is already bad
- Solved a bug in the equality and inclusion check of non-convex parameter constraints (wrong PPL function used)

Export
- PDFC now outputs both an under-approximated good constraint and an under-approximated bad constraint (instead of an over-approximated good constraint for the latter); so presentation of the result changes compared to version 2.8
- Field "State space nature" becomes "Constraint nature" in result (.res) files
- Add L/U status to result (.res) files
- The file name for the graphical cartography becomes model_cart.png for any algorithm (instead of model_cart_ef.png, model_cart_im.png and so on).

Install and compile
- To compile, now use build.sh to compile IMITATOR (in non-distributed mode) and build-patator.sh to compile PaTATOR (distributed mode)

Internal
- In cartography algorithms, the list of tiles is now externalized to a dedicated manager (that can store a list of tiles, or a single good/bad constraints)
- New experimental version of PRPC using an external compositional verifier; hidden option "-mode coverlearning"


*******************************************************
release 2.8    (2016-08-13) MAJOR RELEASE

Major
- New algorithm: parametric deadlock-freeness checking
- Allow for more complex unreachable states in property definition: several locations in several IPTAs can be tested, and discrete variables can be compared with <, <=, =, >=, > and intervals; all this can be mixed using and/or operators.
- Automatic detection of L/U-PTAs, U-PTAs and L-PTAs
- Standardized output for the results of IMITATOR (including a notion of validity of the constraint output)

Bug fixing
- Corrected a problem in the generation of the observer patterns
- Solved an inconsistency in the property syntax of the "always sequence" observer pattern
- Remove three observer patterns that were allowed in the input syntax but not implemented
- Correct the depth-limit option behavior (that used to compute one step further than requested)
- All error messages now displayed on stderr (instead of stdout)

Options
- Added an option "-output-trace-set-verbose" to print trace set with all information contained in the .states file (i.e., the constraint and the constraint projected onto the parameters)
- New options -cart-tiles-limit and -cart-time-limit that operate on the cartography algorithms

Graphics
- Added a visualization of the bad states on the trace set (using red color + a frowney)

Misc
- Memory information now displayed at the end of the execution even in -verbose standard
- Memory information now added to the .res files

Export
- Result file (.res) much more nicely structured. Statistics better integrated both in the terminal output and in the .res files
- Added an export to HyTech (option -PTA2HyTech)
- Removed the automatically generated observer from the PTA export (option -PTA2JPG)
- When exporting to jpg (option -PTA2JPG), the urgent locations are now colored in yellow, and the nosync action (no synchronization name) are now dashed

Versioning
- Now IMITATOR integrates the hash number of GitHub in all outputs

Install and compile
- Using "strip" the binary is now (much) smaller

Internal
- Entire reorganization of the core of IMITATOR: all algorithms rewritten in an object-oriented fashion
- Added a mode to regenerate the IMITATOR input file (helpful to test input/output models)
- Automaton.ml becomes Location.ml (and new module Automaton.ml created); and reorganization of numerous other modules
- Build number only incremented when a flag file "iamadeveloper" is present in the imitator root directory
- "examples" directory becomes "benchmarks"
- New experimental version of EFsynth (usable with a hidden option)
- Non-regression tests now implemented in an external Python script
- Comparator of efficiency with former versions now implemented in an external Python script
